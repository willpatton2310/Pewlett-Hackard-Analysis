# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Challenge
Our task was to provide our client with an analysis of employee data to identify employees that are eligible for retirement (by title) and find those that are eligible for a mentorship program.  The main tool used was Postgresql to perform the analysis.

### Retirement Eligibility
Per the criteria given by the client base on age of the employees, we were able to take all employee records, determine those that were still employed and establish a list of 72,458 employees eligible for retirement by title as follows:

25,916 Senior Engineers
24,926 Senior Staff
9,285 Engineers
7,636 Staff
3,603 Technique Leaders
1,090 Assistant Engineers
2 Managers.

### Mentorship Eligibility
Again, based upon age, the client determined that current employees born in 1965 shoud be elgible for a mentorship program.  Our analysis identified
over 1,549 eligible employess to mentor in preparation to fill these roles.  Given the tenure of the workforce at the company, and the extremely high number of retirement age employees, our recommendation would be to extend the mentorship program to a larger group of candidates.
